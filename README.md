# Hand-written-digit-recognition-torch-js
Canvas in created in HTML5 and JS where digits are written to be detected. Machine Learning Model is trained in Pytorch on MNIST dataset to detect hand written digits. 
Image drawn on the canvas is supplied to the machine learning model deployed in Flask Server, which process the image and do the prediction. 
The result is again shown on the web page provided by the machine learning model. 




Here is a Video Demo of how digits are written on the Canvas and detected
